# doombsp

This is the original node builder used by id Software in the development of Doom. `doombsp` converts a dwd file to a wad.

`doombsp` runs in a terminal. If the `-draw` option is specified, the build process is displayed in a window. This part of the program has been converted from the original, which used AppKit on NeXTSTEP to SDL 2.
